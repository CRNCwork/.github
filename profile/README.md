# When you don't manage your own time and value to others, you become a slave to someone who can direct your time and interactions.

LEAD. *Refuse to ever follow or be influenced by celebrities.* Stop caring what the follower-types think! LEAD! ***Discipline EQUALS freedom.*** 

Minimize your circle. Ditch victims, worriers, materialists. Refuse to ever associate with people governed by fears or the pervasive #MeToo culture of sheep-like victimhood. We LEAD by example; we work on the science, art, entrepreneurial ventures, philanthropic projects and ideas are within our control. Each month, throughout the year, we try to focus particularly on one area of our guru DISCIPLINE, but we use and try to strengthen each one of these areas of DISCIPLINE with every second of every day.

1) Time's the ONLY asset we have. You get 86400 secs/day, 30 or 31 days/month. Plan each month to know your WHY.

2) Avoid idiot compassion. Learn to FORGIVE without forgetting lessons learned. Never HATE, either yourself or others.

3) Pray without ceasing. Synch your will to your Creator's. Focus with reverent intent to fully OWN the DISCIPLINE. 

4) Your method for setting goals, planning tasks becomes your day, your life. Return to basics, eg 30 min time-block.

5) 30 minutes is split into a 25 min MENTAL focus, 4 min focused PHYSICAL exercise Tabata and two 30 sec readjusts.

6) Plan with reverence; set aside one 30 min block to *sharpen the axe* or optimize each of the other time blocks.

7) Devote one entire 30 minute block each day to housekeeping or 5S-ing your work environment; set things in order.

8) Based on experience, optimize the time-blocking details to predictably develop plans, set agendas, get tasks done.

9) Always be flanking! Cheat! Steal lifehacks that work! Experiment with new systems of time mgmt and organization.

10) Stop weakening the body; remove chairs, avoid most sitting; continuously strengthen your [musculoskeletal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system).

11) Minimalism = gratitude. Ditch all vulnerabilities causing worry. Give stuff away; don't rest or be owned by your stuff.

12) As you go thru each day CONTINUOUS COMPOUND mental discipline; focus on the NOWNESS of improvement discipline.
